# Solved Challenges

## Phoenix
Phoenix is _Exploit.Education’s_ next generation of hacking challenges for teaching “basic memory corruption issues such as buffer overflows, format strings and heap exploitation under \[an\] ‘old-style’ Linux system that does not have any form of modern exploit mitigation systems enabled.”[^1] It is the replacement for [Protostar](https://exploit.education/protostar/), the original challenge suite. 

[Click Here](https://secnate.github.io/ctf/phoenix/phoenix-setup/) for an overview of how to set up an environment for solving the Phoenix challenges.
